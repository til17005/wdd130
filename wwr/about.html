                        In business since 1903 when a deal was struck with the local natives for passage across their
                        land.
                        We would purchase supplies from them and in return we were allowed safe travel to enter the
                        snakes
                        mouth; the striking entrance to a fantastic white water journey. We invested in wooden canoes
                        (death traps,
                        I call them) from those same natives. I am positive they were laughing the whole way.
                        <br><br>
                        In those times we catered to trappers and the most greedy of gold diggers. They would travel
                        those
                        serpentine waterways hoping to strike it rich. More often they found disappointment due to
                        losing all of their
                        gear when those death traps flipped. Ahhh, those were the days!
                        <br><br>
                        Nowadays, we use the latest in high tech white water equipment. Safety is our priority. Whether
                        you
                        join a short outing, or mutil-day event, you can trust we will bring you home safe and sound.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Water Snake Rapids began way back when my dad was up north panning for gold. Like so many shmucks before him
                he lost his shirt trying to find success in a dying trade. Although, he did have a good head on his
                shoulders
                and the proof is in the continued success of this business. He was down on his luck with no one to lean on.
                He had been fighting a fever for three days when he came across a small native village. At first he thought
                they were going to kill him, but to his surprise they scraped him off the ground and nursed him back to
                health.
                <br><br>
                He stayed with them for four months and that is where he learned how they traveled the river. They called
                the
                opening between two ridges the snakes mouth. The ridges look like they have fangs that lower into the
                rapids.
                After some brutal negotiations and marrying the cheifs daughter in a ritual he would never speak about, he
                came
                to an arrangement to start this rafting business.
                <br><br>
                The business took off like wildfire. Trappers and gold diggers from all across the land came to travel the
                rapids
                in search for their riches. Most left sad, disappointed and not at all damp ü§£. Good thing we collected
                payment first!

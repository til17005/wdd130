        <h3>About Water Snake Rapids!</h3>
        <p>
            In business since 1903 when a deal was struck with the local natives for passage across their land.
            We would purchase supplies from them and in return we were allowed safe travel to enter the snakes mouth.
            The striking entrance to a fantastic white water journey. We invested in wooden canoes (death traps, I
            call them) from those same natives. I am positive they were laughing the whole way.
            <br><br>
            In those times we catered to trappers and the most greedy of gold diggers. They would travel those
            serpentine
            waterways hoping to strike it rich. More often they found disappointment due to losing all of their gear
            when
            those death traps flipped. Ahhh, those were the days!
            <br><br>
            Nowadays, we use the latest in high tech white water equipment. Safety is our priority. Whether you join a
            short outing, or mutil-day event, you can trust we will bring you home safe and sound.
